This is a fork of https://github.com/Amitabha37377/Awful-DOTS

It features an install and uninstall script to speed up the process. I'm working on a few things including getting rid of the bottom dock.

## Installation

Installing the config may break somethings in your pc as I can only try them in
my computer. But in case you want to use them anyway, follow the bellow steps:-

<details>
<summary><b style="font-size:20px">Install Awesome-git</b></summary>

<br>
<b>Arch</b>

```bash
yay -S awesome-git
```

<br>

<b>Fedora</b><br> You can build from source, or you can use COPR if you are lazy
like me. For installing through COPR, follow below steps:-

```bash
sudo dnf copr enable coolj/awesome-luajit-nightly
sudo dnf install awesome
```

<br>

<b>Ubuntu and other Debian based</b><br> Again, you can build from source, or
you can use pacstall. To install using pacstall, followbelow steps:-

```bash
sudo bash -c "$(wget -q https://pacstall.dev/q/install -O -)"    #for setting up pacstall(Skip if you already done it)
pacstall -I awesome-git
```

</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary><b style="font-size:20px">Install Dependencies</b></summary>

Use the package manager to install the following dependencies:-

**Necessary**
```bash
nm-applet NetworkManager light alsa-utils acpi playerctl scrot picom
```
<i>(Also `libplayerctl-dev` for ubuntu based distributions)</i><br/>

**Optional but recommended for a complete experience**
```bash
redshift gpick nitrogen lxappearance
```
The name of some packages may vary based on your distro.
<i> <b>Note</b>: For Ubuntu and ubuntu/debian based distros additional
dependency `libplayerctl-dev` </i>

</details>
<br>
<details>
<summary><b style="font-size:20px">Move the files to their location</b></summary>

Clone this repository:-

```bash
git clone -b topbar_dock https://github.com/Amitabha37377/Awful-DOTS.git
cd Awful-DOTS
```

Make `~/.themes`, `~/.icons`, `~/.local/share/fonts` directories if not exists
already.

```bash
mkdir ~/.themes
mkdir ~/.icons
mkdir ~/.local/share/fonts
```

Move the files in their required directory:-

```bash
mv ~/.config/awesome ~/.config/awesome.bak
cp -r awesome ~/.config/
cp -r Misc/fonts/* ~/.local/share/fonts/
cp -r Misc/gtk_themes/* ~/.themes/
cp -r Misc/icon_packs/* ~/.icons/
```

</details>
<br>
After following all the steps restart awesome wm. Hopefully everything will work.
To change the default apps and username/profile picture go to the `~/.config/awesome/popups/user_profile.lua` file and make changes.

- #### How to make the media player functional?

  First make sure that `plasma-browser-integration` package is installed in your
  system. Install `plasma integration` browser extension in firefox. Go to the
  manage extension settings of the `plasma integration` extension and uncheck
  `Enhanced Media Control`. Hopefully it will work.
  <i>(The media player might have some bugs/issues right now.)</i>

- #### Setting up the Weather Widget inside dashboard

  First of all make an account in https://openweathermap.org/ and generate the
  api key and get your city ID. Then make a file names `weather.sh` in your home
  directory and put the below script in that file:

  ```bash
  bash -c '
    KEY="<api-key>"
    CITY="<city ID>"
    UNITS="metric"
    weather=$(curl -sf "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?APPID=$KEY&id=$CITY&units=$UNITS")
    if [ ! -z "$weather" ]; then
        
        weather_temp=$(echo "$weather" | jq ".main.temp" | cut -d "." -f 1)

        weather_icon=$(echo "$weather" | jq -r ".weather[].icon" | head -1)
        
        weather_description=$(echo "$weather" | jq -r ".weather[].description" | head -1)
        
        location=$(echo "$weather" | jq -r ".name")
        
        country=$(echo "$weather" | jq -r ".sys.country")
        
        humidity=$(echo "$weather" | jq -r ".main.humidity")
        
        wind=$(echo "$weather" | jq -r ".wind.speed" |  cut -d "." -f 1)
        
        feelslike=$(echo "$weather" | jq -r ".main.feels_like" | cut -d "." -f 1)

        echo "$weather_icon"  "$feelslike" "$weather_temp" "$location" "$country" "$humidity" "$wind" "$weather_description"
        # echo "$weather" 
    else
        echo "... N/A ÔÅû Earth (Probably) N/A N/A Loading..."
    fi'
  ```

  replace the `<api key>` with your actual openweather api key and replace
  `<city ID>` with your city ID in the `weather.sh` file
